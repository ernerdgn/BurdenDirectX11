This project illustrates the preparation and implementation of game engine systems and developed for learning purposes. The technologies and structures discussed here are not limited to game engines alone; they are also employed in 2D/3D design software (Autodesk Fusion, SolidWorks), 2D/3D modeling and animation tools (Autodesk Maya, Blender), as well as simulation applications (Gazebo, RViz). Briefly, this project mainly covers the topics computer graphics and graphical programming.

Furthermore, this is an application-based project. Due to the utilization of the graphical library Direct3D 11, this application exclusively functions on the Windows operating system. The project's architecture is designed to minimize resource consumption, enhance computer performance, and attain more optimal results.

Another crucial aspect of this project is to comprehend the preparation and utilization of in-house game engines. Developers frequently craft their own game engines to tailor them to the specific requirements of the games they are developing. The Burden Engine is a 3D low-level game engine capable of rendering 3D scenes, capturing input from keyboard and mouse, and enabling users to create customized 3D scenes with bespoke models.

The core focus of this project revolves around graphical programming. The process that begins with programming a simple polygon, transmitting it to the graphics card, and ultimately displaying it on the screen is commonly referred to as the graphical pipeline, which is the backbone of real-time rendering in computer graphics. The pipeline involves stages such as geometry transformation, rasterization, pixel shading, and frame buffering.

This project delves into the details of these pipeline stages, exploring how data is processed and manipulated at each step. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of how graphical data is transformed from its initial geometric representation into the final rendered image displayed on the screen.

Additionally, the project examines optimization techniques and algorithms to enhance the efficiency of the graphical pipeline, improving rendering speed and overall graphics performance.
